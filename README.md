# ScaleDojo

### ScaleDojo is a web application for building piano muscle memory for chords and scales.
Using ScaleDojo for ~10 minutes every day should reinforce fundamentals and expand your piano skills by incrementally adding new challenges.

Problems I want to address:
- Notes on screen should mimic real sight reading (i.e. not all notes should look the same)
- Tempo and Dynamics should be recorded and tracked if using a MIDI device to ensure you're learning more than shallow memorization
- History should be saved to show progress over time

Stretch Goals:
- History should be saved to prioritize problem areas
- Let users easily create custom practice routines
